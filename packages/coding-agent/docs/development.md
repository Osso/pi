# Development

See [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/AGENTS.md) for additional guidelines.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono
cd pi-mono
npm install
npm run build
```

Run from source:

```bash
/path/to/pi-mono/pi-test.sh
```

The script can be run from any directory. Pi keeps the caller's current working directory.

## Forking / Rebranding

Configure via `package.json`:

```json
{
  "piConfig": {
    "name": "pi",
    "configDir": ".pi"
  }
}
```

Change `name`, `configDir`, and `bin` field for your fork. Affects CLI banner, config paths, and environment variable names.

## Path Resolution

Three execution modes: npm install, standalone binary, tsx from source.

**Always use `src/config.ts`** for package assets:

```typescript
import { getPackageDir, getThemeDir } from "./config.js";
```

Never use `__dirname` directly for package assets.

## Live Debug REPL

`/debug` enables a privileged JavaScript REPL for the current Pi process. Attach from another terminal with the session ID shown by `/session-id`:

```bash
pi debug attach <session-id>
```

The REPL exposes live runtime state under `pi`. Run `/debug off` in the Pi session to close the endpoint and attached clients. Enable it only for trusted local debugging; evaluated JavaScript has the same system access as Pi.

## Testing

```bash
./test.sh                         # Run non-LLM tests (no API keys needed)
npm test                          # Run all tests
npm test -- test/specific.test.ts # Run specific test
```

## Project Structure
